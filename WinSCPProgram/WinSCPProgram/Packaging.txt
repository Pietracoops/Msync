I could be missing something (I'm nothing of an expert) but after following your steps I still have to package all dll's in the exe folder. Wasn't it OP's intention to have everything packaged into the exe file? – Malabarba Sep 7 '11 at 4:09
@BruceConnor. Linking libraries statically includes them into the executable file. The opposite is called dynamical linking which would let the executable look for dlls (= dunamic link library) at startup. – danijar Jan 26 '13 at 10:42
